# strain_clustering
A project to cluster cannabis strains based on webscraped flavour, effect, and medical use data from Leafly.com

## Project Results
See anaylsis in clusters in "3.2. Hierarchical clustering (best model)" for latest results

A heirarchical clustering method was applied to the 2130 strains (min cut-off: 5 user reviews)

When considering flavour, effect, and medical use all 2130 strains were clustered into four groups:
1. Rise & Shine - distinguishing features: earthy, uplifting, energetic, creative, focused
2. Berry Relaxed - distinguishing features: berry, sweet, tropical, relaxing)
3. Lights Out - distinguishing features: earthy, relaxing, sleepy, pain relief, insomnia
4. Lemon Leaves - distinguishing features: citrus, lemon-lime, energetic, creative, focused
